-- Q4.
--  	a. For each drug in the drug table, return the drug name and then a column named 'drug_type' which says 'opioid' for drugs which have opioid_drug_flag = 'Y', says 'antibiotic' for those drugs which have antibiotic_drug_flag = 'Y', and says 'neither' for all other drugs

--SELECT drug_name, 
-- total_claim_count
--FROM prescription

--		b. For each instance that you found in part a, add a column that indicates whether the drug is an opioid.

-- Q7
--		a. First, create a list of all npi/drug_name combinations for pain management specialists (specialty_description = 'Pain Management) in the city of Nashville (nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'), where the drug is an opioid (opiod_drug_flag = 'Y'). **Warning:** Double-check your query before running it. You will only need to use the prescriber and drug tables since you don't need the claims numbers yet.

--SELECT *
--FROM prescriber CROSS JOIN drug
--WHERE specialty_description = 'Pain Management' AND nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE' AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y';

--		b. Next, report the number of claims per drug per prescriber. Be sure to include all combinations, whether or not the prescriber had any claims. You should report the npi, the drug name, and the number of claims (total_claim_count).

-- SELECT npi, drug_name, COALESCE (total_claim_count, 0) AS total_claims
-- FROM prescriber CROSS JOIN drug
-- 				LEFT JOIN prescription USING (npi, drug_name)
-- WHERE specialty_description = 'Pain Management' AND nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE' AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y';
					

--		c. Finally, if you have not done so already, fill in any missing values for total_claim_count with 0. Hint - Google the COALESCE function.

-- SELECT drug.drug_name, npi, 
-- 	COALESCE(SUM (total_claim_count), 0) AS sum_total_claims
-- 		FROM prescriber
-- 			CROSS JOIN drug
-- 			INNER JOIN prescription USING (npi)
-- 				WHERE specialty_description = 'Pain Management' 
-- 				AND nppes_provider_city = 'NASHVILLE'
-- 				AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
-- 				GROUP BY npi, drug.drug_name
-- 				ORDER BY sum_total_claims DESC;
